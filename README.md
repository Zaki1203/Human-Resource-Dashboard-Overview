# Human-Resource-Dashboard-Overview

## Project Overview 
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive reporting solution designed to provide both high-level insights and detailed analysis of employee data within the organization. The dashboard consolidates key HR metrics into an intuitive and interactive format, supporting strategic decision-making and workforce planning.

##  Project Objective 
The primary objective of this HR Dashboard is to deliver a centralized, interactive platform for monitoring, analyzing, and understanding key HR metrics. The dashboard is structured into four main sections — Overview, Demographics, Income, and Employee Records View — each tailored to support strategic HR decision-making and workforce analysis.

### 1. **Overview**
- Display the **total number of hired, active, and terminated employees** to give a snapshot of current workforce dynamics.
- Visualize **hiring and termination trends over the years** to identify recruitment and attrition patterns.
- Provide a **breakdown of total employees by department and job title** to understand organizational structure.
- **Compare the workforce size** between **headquarters (New York)** and branch offices to monitor distribution.
- Show **employee distribution by city and state** to assess geographic spread and location-based workforce trends.

### 2. **Demographics**
- Present the **gender ratio** to evaluate gender diversity across the organization.
- Visualize the **distribution of employees by age groups and education levels** to analyze workforce composition.
- Show total employees in each age group and each education level** to identify talent demographics.
- Explore the relationship between educational background and performance ratings to assess talent quality and educational impact.

### 3. Income
- *Compare salaries across education levels and genders to detect any income disparities or trends.
- Analyze the correlation between age and salary within each department to assess compensation fairness and trends across age groups.

### 4. Employee Records View
- Provide a comprehensive, filterable table of all employees containing key information such as:
  - Name
  - Department
  - Position
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Education
  - Salary
  - Enable users to filter and sort employee data by any column, supporting deeper individual and group-level analysis.
